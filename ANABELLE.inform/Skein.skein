It&apos;s getting dark outside and Mommy and Daddy haven&apos;t been home for 2 months. There&apos;s strange, dead people walking around outside, making scary noises. I don&apos;t like it here. It is frightening. I&apos;ve run out of food. I need to find a way out.

Apartment Living Room
Our living roomâ€¦or mine now, anyways. There&apos;s our couch in the corner, facing daddy&apos;s TV. A glass coffee table is next to the couch. Our large baywindow looks out to the street.

I can see our kitchen to the west and our bedroom to the south. Our door out is to the east.

Trainyard
I&apos;m here at the trainyard. I see a rail stretching into the distance. A train is on the rail to the north but it is derailed. I can see a small little shack off to the south.

I can see the parking lot west of here and the train to the north.

A zombie takes notice of me!

It&apos;s an old wrench, used many times.
