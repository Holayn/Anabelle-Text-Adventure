It&apos;s getting dark outside and Mommy and Daddy haven&apos;t been home for 2 months. There are strange, dead people walking around outside, making scary noises. I don&apos;t like it here. It is frightening. I&apos;ve run out of food. I need to find a way out.

Apartment Living Room
Our living room…or mine now, anyways. There&apos;s our couch in the corner, facing daddy&apos;s TV. A glass coffee table is next to the couch. Our large bay window looks out to the street.

I can see our kitchen to the west and our bedroom to the south. Our door out is to the east.

Train
I&apos;m standing on the train. It&apos;s derailed, but to the west the train engine car is still on. I look down at my feet and I can see the couple attaching the engine car to the rest of the derailed train.

I can see another train compartment to the east and the engine car to the west.

Our living room…or mine now, anyways. There&apos;s our couch in the corner, facing daddy&apos;s TV. A glass coffee table is next to the couch. Our large bay window looks out to the street.

I can see our kitchen to the west and our bedroom to the south. Our door out is to the east.

I hear some odd groaning noises from behind the front door. Zombies are trying to come in!

Our living room…or mine now, anyways. There&apos;s our couch in the corner, facing daddy&apos;s TV. A glass coffee table is next to the couch. Our large bay window looks out to the street.

I can see our kitchen to the west and our bedroom to the south. Our door out is to the east.

I hear some odd groaning noises from behind the door. Zombies are trying to come in!

Train
I&apos;m standing on the train. It&apos;s derailed, but to the west the train engine car is still on. I look down at my feet and I can see the couple attaching the engine car to the rest of the derailed train.

I can see another train compartment to the east and the engine car to the west.
